# Project Title
**OOP-Car-Project**

This car project is focuses on modeling business problems using java class, creating classes immutable, and user interfaces.
I created this project alone, this project was made for a assignment called Personal Project.
I made this program at FGCU for OOP.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

* Constructor - A specialized method that creates an instance of a class.
* Final - A keyword that qualifies a variable as a constant and prevents a method from being
overridden in a subclass.
* Immutable Class - A class that it can't be overridden by a subclass, in fact it can't be subclassed.
* Interface - Defines constants and methods without implementation
